# Machine Learning Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my Machine Learning learning repository! This is where I document my hands-on journey through **Intro to Machine Learning with Python** by Andreas C. MÃ¼ller and Sarah Guido.

## ðŸŒ± Why This Repo?
- **Hands-on coding exercises** from the book.
- **Daily summaries** of my learnings and reflections.
- Aiming to make this a **transparent record of growth**.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

- **notebooks/**:  
  This folder contains my hands-on **Jupyter notebooks** for each chapter or concept I study. These include code, visualizations, and exercises from the book.

- **notes/**:  
  Here I maintain **summary notes** for each notebook. These capture key takeaways, reflections, and concepts Iâ€™ve learned. Each note is cross-linked to its corresponding notebook.

- **projects/** (coming soon):  
  Iâ€™ll be adding **mini-projects** that apply my machine learning skills to real-world datasets beyond the book.
